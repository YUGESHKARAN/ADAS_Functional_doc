| **DeepSORT** (Deep Simple Online & Realtime Tracking) | Combines detection (bounding boxes) + appearance features (from CNN) + motion model (like Kalman filter). Good to maintain IDs through occlusions. Works well with YOLO detections or similar. Fairly fast. | Appearance model can fail if objects look similar or in poor lighting. Needs good detections each frame. If detection misses, tracker may lose identity. | Roboflow docs for DeepSORT tracker ([trackers.roboflow.com][1]) <br> Implementations like YOLOv4‑DeepSORT ([GitHub][2]) |
| **ByteTrack**                                         | Modern, strong performance in MOT tasks. Better at using “low score” detections rather than discarding them, so it helps recover objects that are harder to detect in some frames.                          | Needs tuning of detection confidence thresholds. Might be heavier in computation.                                                                        | ByteTrack paper / GitHub ([arXiv][3])                                                                                   |
| **SORT** (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)        | Very lightweight; good if you want speed over perfect ID retention. Uses motion (Kalman filter) + matching (IOU) for tracking. Good baseline.                                                               | Without appearance features, IDs may switch when objects cross paths; worse with occlusions. Not robust to large appearance changes.                     | DeepSORT vs SORT comparisons; DeepSORT is improved SORT with appearance metric. ([GitHub][4])                           |
| **HybridTrack**                                       | Newer tracker, claimed good speed + accuracy. Learns parts of the motion model. Validated on KITTI. Could be good match for ADAS. ([arXiv][5])                                                              | Being new, might have less deployment support / less stable code. Might be heavier depending on variant.                                                 |                                                                                                                         |
| **GNN‑PMB**                                           | For 3D multi‑object tracking (especially with LiDAR). Useful if you have LiDAR or multi‑sensor fusion. ([arXiv][6])                                                                                         | Requires LiDAR input or 3D data; more complex; higher cost in sensors and computation.                                                                   |                                                                                                                         |
| **ADA‑Track++**                                       | For multi‑camera 3D tracking. If ADAS uses multiple cameras or wide field of view, this is promising. ([arXiv][7])                                                                                          | More complex pipeline; needs calibration across cameras; hardware + synchronization constraints.                                                         |                                                                                                                         |
