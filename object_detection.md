| **PointPillars** (3D LiDAR + BEV)       | Very fast 3D detector, good performance on KITTI; converts point clouds into “pillars” and processes them efficiently. Useful for detecting objects with depth (distance). Great for forward collision, etc. | Needs LiDAR data; more expensive hardware. Less good for far objects beyond LiDAR range; might need calibration with camera if fusing.                                                           | GitHub implementations like “shangjie‑li/pointpillars” for KITTI. ([GitHub][1]) <br> Reviews show good speed/accuracy tradeoff on KITTI. ([Medium][2])                   |
| **YOLO family** (YOLOv5 / YOLOX / etc.) | Very fast, good detection in 2D; many pre‑trained weights; works on camera video. Can be enhanced for nighttime or IR (thermal) detection. Good trade‑off speed vs. detection quality.                       | 2D detection only; no direct distance unless fused or using additional sensors. May miss small or partially occluded objects unless tuned. Performance degrades in poor lighting unless adapted. | “TIR‑YOLO‑ADAS” is a variant for thermal IR detection in ADAS. ([CiteDrive][3]) <br> General ADAS prototypes using YOLO for “speed vs accuracy” trade‑off. ([GitHub][4]) |
| **SqueezeDet**                          | Designed for low power, efficient detection suitable for embedded systems in vehicles. Single forward pass; not heavy.                                                                                       | Less accurate compared to heavier two‑stage detectors; may struggle with small objects or fine localization.                                                                                     | SqueezeDet paper. ([arXiv][5])                                                                                                                                           |
| **Fusion/Cross‑modal methods**          | Combining segmentation + detection + LiDAR or camera improves accuracy. E.g., *PointPainting* projects semantic segmentation onto LiDAR points to improve detection. Useful for long range / occlusion.      | More complexity; higher computation; needs sensor fusion, calibration; more data handling.                                                                                                       | PointPainting. ([Reddit][6]) <br> Multi‑sensor models like “Camera‑LiDAR Fusion” etc. CLOCs fusion. ([Reddit][7])                                                        |
| **Low‑light / Thermal + IR detection**  | For ADAS at night, in shadows, fog. Specialized systems like TIR‑YOLO‑ADAS. These help maintain detection when visible spectrum fails.                                                                       | Thermal sensors cost more; less detail; may need different training; sometimes fewer classes; calibration issues.                                                                                | TIR‑YOLO‑ADAS. ([CiteDrive][3]) <br> WTEFNet (for low‑light) is also recent work. ([arXiv][8])                                                                           |
